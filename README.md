# Modeling PV Production with Machine Learning

## Challenge Name:
**Modeling PV Production with Machine Learning**

---

## Short Description:
Develop a machine learning model to estimate the energy production of small photovoltaic (PV) systems (<30kWp) using feed-in data, weather information, and egid data. The goal is to enable innovative and intelligent grid- and market-oriented solar energy solutions.

## Description:

### Background:
For small photovoltaic systems (<30kWp), CKW currently only measures the energy fed into its grid. This creates a gap in understanding the actual energy production and self-consumption of these systems. The objective of this challenge is to bridge that gap by developing a machine learning model that can accurately estimate total energy production and self-consumption.  

### Data:
- CKW’s grid includes approximately **9,600 PV systems** smaller than 30kWp without production measurement.  
- Participants will work with:  
  - **Time series energy data**  
  - **Weather data** (provided by Meteomatics)  
  - **EGID data**  
- The dataset is preprocessed with basic feature engineering, allowing participants to focus on building the best possible model.  
- Both traditional machine learning approaches and advanced neural networks, such as **LSTMs**, are encouraged.  

### Why It Matters for CKW:
This challenge has significant real-world implications:  
- Starting next year, PV production will be limited to **70% of the panel’s peak output** as per new regulations.  
- Accurate production estimates will help:  
  - Quantify energy losses due to these limits.  
  - Support the creation of innovative, market-oriented solar energy products.  
  - Enhance CKW’s ability to make solar energy more attractive and efficient for customers.
